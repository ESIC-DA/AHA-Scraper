Put your copy of handle.exe or handle64.exe from the microsoft sysinternals suite in this directory if you want to scan for named pipes.

You can download handle from microsoft here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/handle

Please ensure you run handle.exe or handle64.exe (or preferably attempt to run both) to accept the EULA before trying to use AHA-Scraper to gather pipe info.
